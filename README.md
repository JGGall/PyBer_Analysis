# PyBer_Analysis
*Analyzing ride share data*

## 1. Overview of Analysis
I have been asked to arrange the PyBer ride share data from a region that includes rural, suburban, and urban areas into a summary DataFrame that allows for an at-a-glance understanding of how rides and fares differ among the three types of areas (that is, "city types"). I have also been asked to creat a three-line graph to illustrate total weekly fares for each city type during a particular range of dates, and to give some recommendations.

## 2. Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## 3. Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
