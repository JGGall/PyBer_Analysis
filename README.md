# PyBer_Analysis
*Analyzing ride share data*

## 1. Overview of Analysis
### *Explain the purpose of the new analysis.*
I have been asked to arrange the PyBer ride share data from a region that includes rural, suburban, and urban areas into a summary DataFrame that allows for an at-a-glance understanding of how rides and fares differ among the three types of areas (that is, "city types"). I have also been asked to create a three-line chart to illustrate total weekly fares for each city type during a particular range of dates, and to give some recommendations.

## 2. Results
### *Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.*
There are stark differences among the three city types when it comes to how many rides were taken, how many drivers are available, and in the total amount of fares that were collected. Far more drivers are available in urban areas than in rural, and far more rides were taken in urban areas. It is only to be expected that in urban areas, with higher population density and with more destinations such as entertainment venues and restaurants, more people would want a ride with PyBer and more drivers would want to work for PyBer. Rides in urban areas brought in almost $40,000.00 in fares, whereas rides in suburban areas brought in just over $19,000.00 in fares, and rural areas brought in less than $5,000.00. But a look at the summary DataFrame serves as a reminder that suburban and rural areas also need to be taken into account.

The summary DataFrame above reveals that in rural areas the average ride had a fare that was 41% higher than the average fare in urban areas. In suburban areas, the average fare was 26% higher than in urban areas. Rural areas had only 3% of the drivers of urban areas, but the average rural fare was 335% of the average urban fare--in other words, the average rural fare was more than triple the dollar amount of the average urban fare.

I was also asked to create a three-line chart in "fivethirtyeight" style that plots the sum of the fares per week for a four-month period in each city type: rural, suburban, and urban.

This chart clearly shows the much higher fare revenue of urban areas when compared to suburban areas (which lie in the middle) and rural areas (with the lowest weekly revenue). The three lines plot the rise and decline of weekly revenue over time. The three lines, while situated at different levels representing different fare revenue, are not wildly divergent: they rise and fall together, probably based on weather and holidays and special events that attract people from all three city types in the region.

## 3. Summary
### *Based on the results, provde three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types*
PyBer ought to continue to provide service in all three city types: rural, suburban, and urban. I recommend the fiollowing:
1. Urban areas bring in the most fare revenue and constitute the greatest number of rides. The number of drivers is very large. The company ought to do further research to see if the number of drivers in urban areas is *too* large--that is, if recruiting and training costs are out of alignment with the relatively low average fare per driver.
2. Rural areas bring in only a small amount of revenue, but the average fare per driver is vastly higher than in urban areas--probably as a factor of the great distance that is driven in the typical rural ride. The company should seek to retain all of its rural drivers in order to make sure the service is available to every potential customer in rural areas. PyBer should also make sure potential rural cumstomers understand how easily they can use the service.
3. The company should put its greatest emphasis on recruiting, training, and retaining drivers in suburban areas, and in advertising the service's availability in suburban areas. The average suburban fare is 26% higher than in urban areas, and the average suburban fare per driver is almost 2.4 times the average urban fare per driver. There is great potential for prfit in suburban areas, and also a great potential to help customers meet their travel needs.
