*Analyzing ride share data*

## 1. Overview of Analysis
I have been asked to arrange the PyBer ride share data from a region that includes rural, suburban, and urban areas into a summary DataFrame that allows for an at-a-glance understanding of how rides and fares differ among the three types of areas (that is, "city types"). I have also been asked to create a three-line graph to illustrate total weekly fares for each city type during a particular range of dates, and to give some recommendations.

## 2. Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

There are stark differences among the three city types when it comes to how many rides were taken, how many drivers are available, and in the total amount of fares that were collected. Far more drivers are available in urban areas than in rural, and far more rides were taken.

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
